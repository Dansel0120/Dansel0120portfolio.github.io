           <p>I am a 22-year-old computer engineering graduate from the Philippines. I have a strong enthusiasm for the creative nexus of front-end development and graphic design. Andres Bonifacio College is where I received my education, where I polished my technical abilities and built a strong foundation in computer engineering fundamentals.<br>

            <br>I learned that I have a natural aptitude to combine aesthetics and usefulness throughout my academic career, which inspired me to focus on graphic design and front-end programming. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through pixel-perfect designs and clean, practical coding, whether I'm creating captivating user interfaces or developing immersive digital experiences.<br>
            <br>I have a solid expertise in coding, algorithms, and system architecture thanks to my academic background in computer engineering. I can bridge the gap between design and development thanks to my technological expertise, turning original ideas into effective and useful digital solutions. To keep on the cutting edge of this constantly changing area, I am continually researching the most recent business trends and cutting-edge technologies.
